# MusicBox

## 🎵 Android Music Catalog App

This project is an **Android application** designed in 2025 to display a **catalog of electronic music tracks**.  
Inspired by platforms like **Beatport**, the app focuses on providing **detailed information** about each track **without streaming functionality** (at least initially).

---

## 📱 Project Overview

The app will feature:

- A list of tracks displayed in a clean, scrollable catalog.
- A detail view for each track, including:
  - **Track name**
  - **Artist**
  - **Release title**
  - **Record label**
  - Additional metadata

> Unlike Beatport, the app does **not include audio playback** at this stage.  
> It is intended as an **informational resource** — a curated database of music releases for artists, labels, or fans to explore.

## 🛠️ Backend

A simple backend service will provide the music data in **JSON format**.  
For development and testing purposes, this data will be mocked using the **[Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)** application.

Future versions may integrate with real **APIs** or **databases** to serve dynamic content.
